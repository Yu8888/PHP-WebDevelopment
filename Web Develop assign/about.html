            <li>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about? </li>
            <li>I create the form that student can input specific content such as status code, students can only input
                one "s" and followed four numbers. All input can be saved and searched. </li><br>
            <li>Which parts did you have trouble with? </li>
            <li>When I insert date, MySQL database can only save date format like YYYY-MM-DD, but I changed data type as
                varchar and solve this problem.</li><br>
            <li>What would you like to do better next time? </li>
            <li>Because this time I've done all the required function, the next time I'll focus on the CSS and styles to
                make the view better.</li><br>
            <li>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</li>
            <li>I've used youtube videos and code forum, they help me a lot.</li><br>
            <li>What you have learnt along the way?</li>
            <li>The most important things I've learnt are how to save and serach the information you had saved in the
                database, moreover, how to solve the problems if there were lots of errors when you run codes.</li>
        </ul><br>
